* Update Manager
	- Needs to have a static or global subscribe method so that classes that wish to be updated can add themselves to a correct list
	- Needs to store the components it should update in arrays that are allocated on game start
	- Check if there is a performance increase from using MonoBehaviour.Update, or if MonoBehaviour.Update hogs performance despite not being used
	- It needs to only update things that are active in the scene, check if performance is still better

* Terrain Generation
	- Should generate "RimWorld" looking Terrain
	- To begin with, all tiles that are required are: Water, Grass, "Mountain" (solid rock)
	
	- Split up stuff into different layers such as how Rimworld handles it.
		- Character Layer : Animals, People
		- Item Layer 	  : Weapons, Clothes
		- Furniture Layer : Walls, Chairs, Beds  
		- Floor layers    : Pavement, Flooring
		- Terrain layers  : Water, Grass, Mud


* Perspective
	- Completely top down, RimWorld style
	- Black where no player has been
	- Fog of War where no player can see


* Networking
	- Make it possible for a player to join and control his own characters, 3 to begin with
